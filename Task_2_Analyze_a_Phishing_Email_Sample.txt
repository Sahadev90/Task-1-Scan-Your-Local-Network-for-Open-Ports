Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample.

1. Obtain a sample phishing email.

    Subject Line: "Important: Your Account Will Be Suspended"
    Sender: support@secure-paypal.com
    Date Received: May 26, 2025
    Attachments: Invoice.pdf
    Links Present: Yes (1 link)

2.Examine sender's email address for spoofing.

    Claimed sender: support@secure-paypal.com

    Analysis: The email claims to be from PayPal, but the domain is secure-paypal.com, which is not an official PayPal domain.

    Phishing Indicator: Likely spoofed domain used to impersonate PayPal.

3. Check email headers for discrepancies.

    Tool Used: MxToolbox Header Analyzer

    Findings:

    SPF (Sender Policy Framework) fail

    DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) fail

    Received from suspicious IP not associated with PayPal.

    Phishing Indicator: Email headers show failed authentication and routing through unknown servers.

4.Identify suspicious links or attachments.

    Displayed Link: Log in to verify

    Actual URL (hovered): http://paypalsecure-update.com/verify

    Phishing Indicator: Displayed link is legitimate-looking but redirects to a suspicious domain.

5.Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.

    Phrases like:

    “Immediate action required”

    “Your account will be suspended within 24 hours”

    Phishing Indicator: Common fear-based tactics to prompt rash user action.

6.Note any mismatched URLs.

    File: Invoice.pdf

    Suspected to contain malware (not opened for safety)

    Phishing Indicator: Unsolicited attachment with financial terminology to encourage clicks.


7.Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors.

    Example: “Your acount has been compromised. Plase verify imidiately.”

    Phishing Indicator: Poor grammar and spelling reduce credibility and hint at phishing.


8.Summarize phishing traits found in the email.

| Indicator             | Description                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Sender Spoofing       | Uses fake domain similar to PayPal |
| Header Discrepancies  | SPF and DKIM checks failed         |
| Mismatched URLs       | Links point to phishing site       |
| Urgent Language       | Threat of account suspension       |
| Suspicious Attachment | Potential malware in invoice       |
| Grammar Errors        | Multiple spelling/grammar mistakes |


8. Conclusion
     This email demonstrates multiple classic phishing characteristics and should not be trusted. Users are advised to report the message to their email provider and avoid clicking any links or opening attachments.
